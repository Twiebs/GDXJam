##Concept Document
All ideas need to be well explained and ranked by priority.
##Essential
1. The game will contain autonomous agents that are controlled by an overseer/player.
2. day/night mechanic
2. Having units seamlessly convert from nighttime to daytime roles and vice vesa.
3. gdx-ai, ashley, and box2d are being used


##Possible
1. Hero's will evolve over time like a simplified version of a genetic algorithm, but with player selection instead of being selected by the algorithm automatically based on criteria.![alt text](https://groups.google.com/group/libgdx-jam/attach/c37acfee929861fb/IMG_20150207_082939.jpg?part=0.1&authuser=0&view=1 "")


3. This is what I envision a possible nighttime scenario to look like (very roughly). Basically this player would be risking losing a platoon that is farming at night for the reward of resources. That's the kind of risk vs reward scenarios I hope pop up very naturally in this game.
