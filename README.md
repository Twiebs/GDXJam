##Concept Document
All ideas need to be well explained and ranked by priority.
##Essential
1. The game will contain autonomous agents that are controlled by an overseer/player.

##Possible
1. Hero's will evolve over time like a simplified version of a genetic algorithm, but with player selection instead of being selected by the algorithm automatically based on criteria.![alt text](https://groups.google.com/group/libgdx-jam/attach/c37acfee929861fb/IMG_20150207_082939.jpg?part=0.1&authuser=0&view=1 "")

1. All the units should be autonomous with unique and predictable behaviors
2. Deciding how to plan your attack you can decide what loadout of units and hero to take into battle and where (within reason) to spawn them

##If we have enough time

##Rejected
